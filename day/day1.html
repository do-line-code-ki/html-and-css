<h1>Day 1: My First HTML Code, after very long time</h1>
<h1> This my first headline after very long time</h1>
<p> This is my first paragraph after very long time</p>
<p> This is my second paragraph after very long time</p>
<p> Every day I will practice html and css by creating new files by the name of
day 1, day 2, day 3, day 4, day 5 and so on. These files will help me see how far
i have come in terms of learning and practical use of the language</p>

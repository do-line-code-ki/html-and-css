<h1>Day 2: Structure of a HTML Document</h1>
<p> I just read about the elements and tags. I will describe it for you what I have just read</p>
<h2> What is an HTML element ?</h2>
<p> Every line of code that you write in html document stating with a < opening tag> and ending with a < closing tag > is called an element.
<p> For example:
  <p>This line that you are reading is currently wrapped inside p tags.
<p>So this whole line of code < p > This line that you are reading is currently wrapped inside p tags. < /p > is called an HTML element</p>
<p> This whole chunk of text is inside < body > element and < body > elements is inside < HTML > ELEMENT.

<H2>So what is tag ?</H2>
  <p> A tag is a part of an elements with 2 variants: opening tag and closing tag

<H2> So, do all tag have opening and closing tags ?</H2>
<p> No, there are some tags known as Standalone tags like < br > (To add a new line). So it is best advised
  to not use tags without closing tags. Best practice is to close tags whenever you open one</p>

<h2> Let's talk about attributes </h2>
<p> Attributes are special qualities you add to an element. These qualities are declared after opening a html tag. For example:
<p> this line that you are reading has a <a href="https://google.com"> clickable link</a>, this link is added by using href attribute inside an < a > tag.
<p> Similarly, the lang="en" we use after opening the < html > tag is also an attribute.
<p> Go back to the clickable line, did you notice something ? What?!!!!
<!-- :) I am Right Here!  -->
<p> We used an < a > tag inside a < p > tag, a tag inside a tag, this is called NESTING or NESTED TAGS.
<P> When using nested tags it is necessary you close the inner tags first before closing the outer tag.
<p> this is inner an outer tags have special names for them: parent tag (for outer tag) and child tag (for inner tag)
<h2> Let's talk <p>about</p> attributes </h2>
<p> See what we did with the heading ?
<p> we inserted a p tag inside a heading tag. Though it is not good practice but we did it just to show the implications of nesting.
<p> if you see a tag YOU CAN NEST IT but that DOESN'T mean YOU SHOULD NEST IT</p>
